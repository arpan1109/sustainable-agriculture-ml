# \# Sustainable Agriculture — Reducing Chemical Inputs with AI/ML

# 

# \## Project Goal

# To minimize chemical fertilizer and pesticide usage by recommending crops

# that are naturally suited to soil nutrients and environmental conditions.

# 

# \## Dataset

# Crop Recommendation Dataset from Kaggle.  

# Stored under `data/raw/crop\_recommendation.csv`.

# 

# \## Repo Structure

# \- `data/raw/` → raw dataset

# \- `data/processed/` → cleaned/processed data

# \- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks (EDA, models)

# \- `src/` → helper scripts

# \- `reports/` → figures, charts

# \- `models/` → trained ML models

# 

# \## Week 1 Deliverables

# ✅ Dataset collected and stored  

# ✅ Repo structured  

# ✅ Requirements + Data Card added  

# 

# Next: \*\*Week 2 → Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\*\*
